## Data Transformation
The data was had to go through cleaning and transformation phase in Power Query which is the kitchen of power bi. The data cleaning phase helps get our data ready for analysis. [See screenshots below]

## Data Modelling
Here we create relationships in our tables
I created a Calendar Table, see the code below;

![](calendar_Table.png)

   #CalendarTable = 
   ADDCOLUMNS(
       CALENDAR(MIN('dim_order'[order_date]), MAX('dim_order'[order_date])),
       "Year", YEAR([Date]),
       "Month", FORMAT([Date],"mmm"),
       "Month no", MONTH([Date]),
       "Quater", FORMAT([Date], "\QQ"),
       "Day", FORMAT([Date],"ddd"),
       "Day no", WEEKDAY([Date])

   )

 ***A calculated column for customers_name was created to hold first and lastname in a single column using the code below.**
 ![](Transform.png) 
 
 Customer_name = CONCATENATE('dim_customer'[customer_first_name]," " &  'dim_customer'[customer_last_name])

**Hope you can see the beauty of modelling your data**ðŸ˜‰


## Data Visualization ðŸ“Š
Here, I utilized a variety of effective visualizations, including maps, KPI cards, line charts, column charts, tables, and bar charts, to present my analysis and findings. By employing these appropriate visuals, I aimed to facilitate understanding of complex information and enable decision-makers to derive valuable insights from the data. To present the comprehensive analysis, I created a three-page report, which included these visualizations. Please refer to the attached images below to visualize the report.
